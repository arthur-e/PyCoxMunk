.. _PCM_Quickstart:
Quickstart
==========

Pycoxmunk operates in tandem with the  `satpy library <https://github.com/pytroll/satpy>`_, and it is recommended that
users new to working with satellite data first familiarise themselves with the basic operation of _satpy_ before
beginning to use _pycoxmunk_.

This page gives a brief overview of how to use _pycoxmunk_. Further information can be found in the
`API documentation <pcm_api>`_ and in the example code / notebooks that are part of the _pycoxmunk_
`github repository <https://github.com/simonrp84/PyCoxMunk/tree/main/Examples>`_.
