The main functionality of `pycoxmunk` is accessible through the `PyCoxMunk <api/pycoxmunk>`_ class, which makes use of
several helper classes and functions:
 - `CM_Constants <api/cmconsts>`_
 - `CM_PixMask <api/cmpixmask>`_
 - `CM_SceneGeom <api/cmscenegeom>`_
 - `CM_Shared_Wind <api/cmwind>`_
 - `CM_Utils <api/cmutils>`_

The individual pages above give more details about each of these.
